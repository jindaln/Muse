# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

a safeword app for android devices that calls/texts emergency services when a safe word is spoken, sort of like the "hey, siri" or "ok, google" feature
an app where you enter a time when you want to walk from your current location and it finds friends who also want to leave at the same time so that you don't have to walk alone
self care calendar: reminds you to get enough sleep, drink enough water, schedule time for excercise
bitchy personal trainer: a mean app that keeps an eye on your location and if you haven't been to the gym in the past few days it yells at you (preferably in malan's voice if he consents)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Nikita Jindal- TF: Caroline Teicher

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If the project is large of scope, will we be penalized if we can't implement the entire thing?
Does the UI have to be nice or can it be yucky if the back end logic is really complicated?
