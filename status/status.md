Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have planned out app.py (written out the routes), made all but 4 of our HTML templates and 2 of our routes, set up a SQL database with 3 tables.
We have also debugged enough that a user can register, log in, and see their history successfully and the program can distinguish between types of users (teacher and student)

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

HTML templates:
make quiz (for teacher to access)
share (for teacher to share the quiz)
take quiz (for student)
students see graded quiz

Routes:
make (to assemble the quiz)
take (to take the quiz)

Some aesthetic issues with the layout

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

1. Our navbar is wavy and we don't know why we just used the code from finance it should work
2. We are using the session_name in php to distinguish between teachers and students. We feel that this is wrong but it works. Please help.
3. The database is frustrating us. It keeps prompting us for a password which goes away when we reload the file. Sometimes it says application not found,
which is also resolved by reloading the file. Once again, we just stole the database from finance. Why isn't it working? Help?
